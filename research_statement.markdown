My main research interests is the design of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms to solve the practical industrial computer vision problems. I am interested in methods that learn from both annotated data in public domain, and problem-specific data with sparse or no annotation within the industry. I am also interested the algorithms that combine the rich, manually designed feature representations from domain experts, and the recent deep learning methods. By integrating them, we can get the most from domian knowledge and sparse training data.

Another related new research line I started while working at industry is reinforcement learning (RL). The algorithm libraries of RL, and its application to industrial problem is less developed than that of conventional supervised and unsurprised learning. I am interested in how industries such as robotics and manufacturing can potentially benefit from this line of research.
