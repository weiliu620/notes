### Deep Learning for Detecting Robotic Grasps

### Learning Hand-Eye Coordination for Robotic Grasping with Deep Learning and Large-Scale Data Collection

### On Learning to Think: Algorithmic Information Theory for Novel Combinations of Reinforcement Learning Controllers and Recurrent Neural World Models

### Compressed Network Search Finds Complex Neural Controllers with a Million Weights

### Value Iteration Network
If action moves agent locally, then can be computed with convolution.

### feedback Network

Iterative representations based on feedback from previous iteration's output. Benefits: early prediction, hierarchical output (taxonomy), provide basis for curriculum learning. [what is it]

### Cognitive Mapping and Planning for Visual Navigation

J. Malik's lab. Mapping is driven by the need of planner. Spatial memory, can plan with incomplete observations of the world. Agent has a belief map of the world. [heavy in mapping, skip it for now]

### DeepMPC: Learning Deep Latent Features for Model Predictive Control

Ian Lenz's paper.

### Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Probabilistic Model Predictive Control

Sent to Tom but haven't read it yet.

### Gaussian Process Model Based Predictive Control

### Predictive control with Gaussian process models

### Deep Recurrent Q-Learning for Partially Observable MDPs
Peter Stone's work

### Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning
Original EQN contains a maximization step over estimated values, and this max step is an biased towards higher values. The paper shows DQN has overestimates even when network is deep and environment is deterministic.
