### Value Iteration Network
If action moves agent locally, then can be computed with convolution.

### feedback Network

Iterative representations based on feedback from previous iteration's output. Benefits: early prediction, hierarchical output (taxonomy), provide basis for curriculum learning. [what is it]

### Cognitive Mapping and Planning for Visual Navigation

J. Malik's lab. Mapping is driven by the need of planner. Spatial memory, can plan with incomplete observations of the world. Agent has a belief map of the world. [heavy in mapping, skip it for now]

### DeepMPC: Learning Deep Latent Features for Model Predictive Control

Ian Lenz's paper.
